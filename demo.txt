The New York Daily News, officially titled the Daily News, is an American newspaper based in Jersey City, New Jersey. It was founded in 1919 by Joseph Medill Patterson in New York City as the Illustrated Daily News.

It was the first U.S. daily printed in tabloid format.
 It reached its peak circulation in 1947, at 2.4 million copies a day. As of 2019, it was the eleventh-highest circulated newspaper in the United States. (Today's Daily News is not connected to the earlier New York Daily News, which shut down in 1906.) For much of the 20th century the paper operated out of the Daily News Building with its large globe in the lobby.

The Daily News is owned by parent company Tribune Publishing. 
This company was acquired by Alden Global Capital, which operates its media properties through Digital First Media, in May 2021.[5][6][7][8][9] After the Alden acquisition, alone among the newspapers acquired from Tribune Publishing, the Daily News property was spun off into a separate subsidiary called Daily News Enterprises.[10]

The Daily News was not an immediate success, and by August 1919, 

the paper's circulation had dropped to 26,625.[11] Still, New York's many subway commuters found the tabloid format easier to handle, and readership steadily grew. By the time of the paper's first anniversary in June 1920, circulation had climbed over 100,000 and by 1925, over a million. Circulation reached its peak in 1947, at 2.4 million daily and 4.7 million on Sunday.[13][14]

The Daily News carried the slogan "New York's Picture Newspaper" from 1920 to 1991, for its emphasis on photographs. A camera has been part of the newspaper's logo from day one.[15] It became one of the first newspapers in New York City to employ a woman as a staff photographer, in 1942, when Evelyn Straus was hired.[16][17]: 8, 31–32  The paper's later slogan, developed from a 1985 ad campaign, is "New York's Hometown Newspaper", while another has been "The Eyes, the Ears, the Honest Voice of New York". The Daily News continues to include large and prominent photographs, for news, entertainment and sports, as well as intense city news coverage, celebrity gossip, classified ads, comics, a sports section, and an opinion section.
