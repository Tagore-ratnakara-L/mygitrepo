The New York Daily News, officially titled the Daily News, is an American newspaper based in Jersey City, New Jersey. It was founded in 1919 by Joseph Medill Patterson in New York City as the Illustrated Daily News.

It was the first U.S. daily printed in tabloid format. It reached its peak circulation in 1947, at 2.4 million copies a day. As of 2019, it was the eleventh-highest circulated newspaper in the United States. (Today's Daily News is not connected to the earlier New York Daily News, which shut down in 1906.) For much of the 20th century the paper operated out of the Daily News Building with its large globe in the lobby.

The Daily News is owned by parent company Tribune Publishing. This company was acquired by Alden Global Capital, which operates its media properties through Digital First Media, in May 2021.[5][6][7][8][9] After the Alden acquisition, alone among the newspapers acquired from Tribune Publishing, the Daily News property was spun off into a separate subsidiary called Daily News Enterprises.[10]
